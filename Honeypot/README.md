A honeypot is a decoy system used to attract and trap cyber attackers, diverting them from real targets and allowing you to study their methods and gather valuable threat intelligence

### Scope of the Project

This project focuses on deploying and monitoring an internal honeypot environment using the following components:

- **Cowrie**: A medium‐interaction SSH/Telnet honeypot used to emulate a vulnerable system and capture attacker commands, malware downloads, and brute-force attempts.
- **Zeek**: A powerful network analysis framework used to log and interpret network traffic patterns, enabling deeper insight into attacker behavior and lateral movement attempts.
- **Suricata**: A network intrusion detection and prevention engine used to generate alerts and detect malicious signatures or abnormal traffic activity.
- 
In selecting Cowrie, Zeek, and Suricata, the goal was to create a balanced environment capable of capturing both the *how* and the *why* behind attacker activity. 
By combining this tools, this project will help me build a more comprehensive understanding of adversary tactics within a controlled internal network.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose and role of honeypots in cybersecurity.
- Deploy and configure a honeypot in a controlled environment.
- Monitor and analyze malicious activity captured by the honeypot.
- Document findings to improve threat detection and security response.
