 ## 2️⃣Virtual Machine configuration for credential scans

- Enable Remote registry in your Windows 11 so the scanner is able to connect to the VM registry

- On User Account Control disable so the scanner can connect to the VM domain

- In user account registry editor you will need to further disable user account control

- Locate this  registry  **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system**

    - Right-Click and click on New
    - Click on "DWORD (32 bit value)
    - name it LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy .

Go on the credentials tab and enter the username and password of your windows virtual machine

Save and go back to My Scans and run the scan with the new credentials settings


## 4️⃣ Download a deprecated Mozilla Firefox and run scans (with Credentials)

Download the old Mozilla Firefox version here :

https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/3.6.12/win32/en-GB/

After downloading you should scan and you should notice more vulnerabilities

## 5️⃣ Addressing the Vulnerabilities
Once you have identified vulnerabilities in the deprecated Mozilla Firefox version, you have two options to manage the risk:

🟢 Option 1: Risk Avoidance (Completely Remove Deprecated Firefox)
Risk avoidance means eliminating the vulnerable software entirely to prevent potential exploits.

- Steps to Uninstall Mozilla Firefox 3.6.12:
- Open the Control Panel in Windows.
- on Programs and Features.
- Locate Mozilla Firefox 3.6.12 in the list.
- Right-click and select Uninstall.
- Follow the prompts to remove Firefox completely.
  
💡 After uninstallation, rescan using Nessus to verify that the vulnerabilities are gone.

🟡 Option 2: Risk Mitigation (Update to the Latest Firefox Version)
Risk mitigation reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk by applying security updates.

Steps to Update Mozilla Firefox:
- Download the latest version of Mozilla Firefox from the official website:
👉 https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/
- Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation steps.
- Restart your system to apply changes.
  
💡 After updating, rescan using Nessus to verify that the vulnerabilities have been patched.
