<h1> Wireshark is a powerful, open-source network protocol analyzer which can be used to analyse network traffic and identify suspicious or malicious network traffic. </h1>

## Learning Objectives

#### - Understand what Wireshark is used for and when packet capture is helpful.

#### - Learn how to start, stop, and save packet captures in Wireshark.

#### - Identify the difference between capture filters and display filters.

#### - Apply basic display filters to isolate specific network traffic (e.g., by IP, protocol, or port).

#### - Generate network traffic intentionally (e.g., using ping, web browsing, or simple client/server activity) and observe it in Wireshark.

#### - Inspect packet structure (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP headers) and interpret key fields.

#### - Save, export, and document packet captures for analysis or reporting.
