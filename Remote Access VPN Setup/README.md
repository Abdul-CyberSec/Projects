## In this tutorial we will be looking at how to set up a secure VPN on a Proxmox server using WireGuard or Tailscale, allowing remote access without exposing ports.

<h2>‚ùóFirst of all you should already have: </h2>

- A running Proxmox VE server

- A Debian/Ubuntu LXC container for the Wireguard/Tailscale VPN
  
- Network on the container should be set on static


  <h1> If you are installing WireGuard follow this following steps: </h1> 

  <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Install WireGuard inside our container</h3>
  
  SSH into the main node and run this script:
  
  bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/ct/wireguard.sh)"
  
  **Script Source: https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/**

  # After the install it will give you an ip address were wireguard will be running off e.g. 192.168.**.**:10086

  <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Copy and paste that IP to the search bar and you should be welcomed with this sign in page: </h3>

default user and password is admin | admin

You will  then be prompted to create an account 

<h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ On the homepage click on configuration where you will be able to create the WireGuard tunnel to create the VPN connection </h3>

 set listen port to 1194, and for the ip address use 10.0.0.1/24

<h3>4Ô∏è‚É£ After that you will need to create the actual client in order to use the VPN </h3>

## click this button:

**you can leave the settings as default**


Then VPN will be ready ‚ùó


 <h1> If you are installing Tailscale follow this following steps: </h1> 

  <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Tailscale inside our container </h3>
  
  SSH into the into the container, and run this script:
  
  curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
  ## Script Source:(https://tailscale.com/download/linux)

  **Enabling SSH connection in the container**
  
  Log in to the container using default user name root and password you picked when you set it up
  then type this to enable a SSH connection:
  
  nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  
  Find PermitRootLogin and remove # and add yes after it

  ctrl + O to save and the ctrl + X to exit nano mode

 <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Before setting up Tailscale, enable IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding to allow subnet advertising.</h3>

 to enable that use this nano command :

 **nano /etc/sysctl.conf**

  scroll down and uncomment the lines like the image shown below :

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1df0995f-1e4b-423d-b808-86fc269048ee)

  ctrl + O to save and the ctrl + X to exit nano mode

  **SHUTDOWN THE CONTAINER**
  
  <h3>3Ô∏è‚É£Run command lines into Proxmox main node in SSH</h3>

  enter this command :

 nano /etc/pve/lxc/103.conf

  **NOTE** 103 is my LXC ID in your case it might be different

  then add this two command lines below the unpriveleged line:
  
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 10:200 rwm

lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net/tun dev/net/tun none bind,create=file

**Script Source: https://tailscale.com/kb/1130/lxc-unprivileged**

<h3>4Ô∏è‚É£ TAILSCALE IS UP AND READY</h3>

Start the container by running:

tailscale up --advertise routes=**YOUR IP ADDRESS** --advertise-exit-node

**scripts:** 

https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets

https://tailscale.com/kb/1408/quick-guide-exit-nodes

it will give you and url and paste it into your search bar and you will be prompted to log in into tailscale

you will then be connected 


**NOTE** : make sure to disable key expiry and enable both subnet route and exit node you can do that by :

click on the three dots of your newly created tailscale machine 

click disable key expiry

click on the three dots again and right click on edit route settings and enable both it should look like the image below

# Congratulations! üéâ You have successfully set up **WireGuard/Tailscale VPN on Proxmox**. Now, you can securely access your Proxmox web interface from anywhere
