<h1>Control Categories and Types</h1>

<p>Cybersecurity controls are grouped into <strong>three primary categories</strong>. Each plays a critical role in protecting organizational assets, ensuring secure operations, and reducing risk exposure.</p>

<h2>Control Categories</h2>

<h3>1. Administrative / Managerial Controls</h3>
<p>These controls address the <strong>human and procedural</strong> elements of cybersecurity. They include policies and procedures that govern how data is managed, who is responsible for protecting it, and how the organization enforces security obligations. Although administrative controls are policy-based, their enforcement may require the use of technical or physical controls.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Policies and procedures</li>
  <li>Employee responsibilities</li>
  <li>Access control definitions</li>
  <li>Governance and compliance actions</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Technical Controls</h3>
<p>Technical controls utilize <strong>technology-based mechanisms</strong> to protect systems, networks, and data. These controls enforce confidentiality, integrity, and availability through automated or system-defined processes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firewalls, IDS/IPS</li>
  <li>Encryption mechanisms</li>
  <li>Antivirus solutions</li>
  <li>Password management systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Physical / Operational Controls</h3>
<p>These controls focus on <strong>protecting physical assets</strong> from unauthorized access. They prevent tampering, environmental damage, and theft by limiting who can physically interact with critical infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locks and badge readers</li>
  <li>Lighting and signage</li>
  <li>CCTV surveillance</li>
  <li>Secured cabinets and physical barriers</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Control Types</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity controls can also be categorized based on their <strong>function</strong> and security impact:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Preventative</strong> – Stop an incident from occurring</li>
  <li><strong>Corrective</strong> – Restore operations after an incident</li>
  <li><strong>Detective</strong> – Identify events that have occurred or are occurring</li>
  <li><strong>Deterrent</strong> – Discourage malicious activity by increasing perceived risk</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these controls form a <strong>defense-in-depth</strong> strategy, ensuring multiple layers of protection across organizational systems.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This audit will assess existing controls, identify gaps, and determine whether current measures provide effective defense in depth, support compliance requirements, and reduce security risks across the organization’s infrastructure.</p>
