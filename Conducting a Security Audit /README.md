<h1>  Introduction </h1>

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their IT department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

This internal audit was necessary because the IT manager was worried about maintaining compliance and business operations.

The purpose of this audit is to better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets and ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   


<h1>Scope & Frameworks </h1> The scope of this audit is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys.
This includes their assets like employee equipment and devices, their internal network,
and their systems. You will need to review the assets Botium Toys has and the controls
and compliance practices they have in place.

The IT manager has implemented the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) which will help me guide this audit
